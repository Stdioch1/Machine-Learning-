# Machine-Learning-Linear Regression for Iris Dataset Classification
This project involves implementing a linear regression model to classify the Iris dataset. By employing both simple and multivariate linear regression techniques, the model aims to predict the class of Iris flowers based on their features. The process includes data preprocessing, model training, and cross-validation to ensure accuracy and prevent overfitting. This project demonstrates the practical application of linear regression in machine learning for classification tasks.
